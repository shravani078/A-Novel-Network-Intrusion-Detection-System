🔄 How It Works

The system follows the following pipeline:

Network Traffic
      ↓
Packet Capture / CSV Input
      ↓
Network Flow Extraction
      ↓
Feature Extraction
      ↓
Feature Scaling

      +
Autoencoder Anomaly Detection
      ↓
Risk Assessment
      ↓
Dashboard and Alerts
```

📥 Input and 📤 Output

1.Input

The system receives:

- Live network packets
- CSV-based network-flow data
Raw packets are not directly given to the AI models. They are first converted into network flows and numerical features.

```text

AI/ML Models
```

2.Output

The system can produce:

- Predicted traffic class
- Attack category
- Anomaly status
- Anomaly score
- Risk information
- Detection events
- Dashboard updates
- Security alerts
The exact attack categories depend on the classes used during model training.

🧠 Machine Learning Models

1.CNN-LSTM
The primary deep learning model combines:
- **CNN** – Learns useful patterns from network traffic features.
- **LSTM** – Captures sequential and temporal dependencies in traffic behavior.
The trained model is stored at:
```text
results/best_cnn_lstm.keras
```

---
2.Autoencoder
The Autoencoder is used for anomaly detection.
It learns to reconstruct learned traffic patterns. A high reconstruction error indicates that the observed traffic differs significantly from the learned patterns.
The trained model is stored at:
```text
results/best_autoencoder.keras
```
The anomaly threshold is stored at:
```text
results/ae_threshold.npy
```
> The Autoencoder can help identify potentially unusual or previously unseen behavior, but it does not guarantee detection or exact classification of every zero-day attack.

---
3.XGBoost
XGBoost is used as a traditional machine learning baseline for comparison with the deep learning approach.
The trained model is stored at:
```text
results/xgboost_model.pkl
```
---
📊 Dataset

The project uses the **CIC-IDS-2017 dataset** for model development and evaluation.
The dataset contains benign and malicious network traffic and includes multiple attack scenarios such as:
- DoS
- DDoS
- PortScan
- Brute-Force attacks
- Botnet activity
- Other malicious network traffic

Official dataset:
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html
The complete dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size.
